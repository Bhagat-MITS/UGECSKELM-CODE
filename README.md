This is implementation of the paper: Bhagat S. Raghuwanshi Universum graph-embedded class-specific kernelized extreme learning machine for handling class imbalance

Description of files:

Similar setting for all use datasets (keel dataset repository)

KERNEL_haberman.m: selecting parameters of UGECSKELM using 5-fold cross-validation. One can select parameters l, λ and  σ to be used in grid-search method.

UGECSKELM.m: implementation of UGECSKELM algorithm. Takes parameters l, λ and  σ and training data and test data, and provides accuracy obtained and running time.
 
 The code has been tested on MATLAB R2018b software, an 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700 processor operating at 2.50GHz with 16.0 GB RAM, and a Windows-11 operating platform.
