This is implementation of the paper: Bhagat S. Raghuwanshi Universum graph-embedded class-specific kernelized extreme learning machine for handling class imbalance

Description of files:

pima.m: selecting parameters of UGECSKELM using 5-fold cross-validation. One can select parameters l, λ and  σ to be used in grid-search method.

UGECSKELM.m: implementation of UGECSKELM algorithm. Takes parameters l, λ and  σ and training data and test data, and provides accuracy obtained and running time.
 
 The code has been tested on Windows 10 with MATLAB R2018b.
